four different type of computures 

SISD - single instruction single data 
    * simple computers 
SIMD - single instruction multi data 
    * Vector or array computers 
MISD - multi instruction single data
    * Fault tolerant computer systems performing redundant computing 
MIMD - multi instruction multi data
    * Computers with multi-core processors 

// Distributive Computing 
multithreaded programming is seen in languages like Java and C#. 

// XML 
Extensible markup language, used by SOAP and WSDL to define service that can be 
transferred and understood between programming languages. 

Is similar in structure to HTML but is used for semantic puposes 

Some Rules for XML: 
Rule 1 : Name tags are case sensitive
Rule 2 : Every opening tag must have a closing tag
Rule 3 : Every document must have a root
Rule 4: Welformed XML document has an xml tag

// WSDL 
Web service description language 

Four critical aspects of Web services:
–   Functionality description of the services in standard 
    taxonomy;
–   Contract of parameter types and return type of the 
    function (service) calls;
–   Binding information about the transport protocol to be 
    used, usually, SOAP;
–   Address information for locating the specified service.
